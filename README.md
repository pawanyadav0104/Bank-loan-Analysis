🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
MySQL – for storing and querying structured data

Python – for data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)

pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sqlalchemy

Power BI – for creating interactive dashboards and reports



🔍 Steps Performed
1. Data Ingestion
Imported CSV file using Pandas.

Uploaded structured data into MySQL for better querying and relational handling.

2. SQL Querying
Used SQL for:

Summarizing loan amount by region

Identifying overdue loans

Ranking customers based on deposits

Aggregating repayment performance

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Checked for missing values, outliers, and data types.

Performed:

Distribution analysis of loan amounts

Correlation between loan amount and deposits

Default rates by loan type

Tools: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

4. Power BI Dashboard
Created an interactive dashboard showing:

Loan approval trends

Top regions with high default

Average loan and deposit by age group

Filters for gender, loan type, repayment status
